> Beirut is not a city best seen from the window of a speeding car. 

Stunning geographical location aside, our city is not blessed with obvious beauty. Its gems are, for the most part, well hidden, whether this is by inconsiderate construction, high walls, neglect or decay. 

For all the extraversion of its inhabitants, this is a city of interiors, of secret gardens and intriguing side streets, of lavish palaces marooned in less-than-uninviting surroundings, of histories hidden by the demographic fracturing the city has undergone. Which is why the way most of us see the city every day, does it too little justice.
