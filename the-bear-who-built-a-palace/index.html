Unlike the Mansour Assaf, which had stood inside the city walls (Beirut did not begin to expand beyond its ancient footprint until the 19th Century), the Petit Serail was built outside and replaced a caravanserai that had stood near one of the city gates, the Bab as-Saraya, for several hundred years.</p><p>Ostensibly, the new location of the governor’s residence was meant to reflect the city’s transformation growth, a process that even then showed little respect for the past. As the Ottomans busily transformed the narrow cobblestone streets of the Old City into a polished new Mediterranean metropolis, the 16th Century Mansour Assaf Palace was demolished (along with Emir Fakhreddine’s Palace, parts of which dated back to the Crusades) to make way for a new street, running from the St. Georges Maronite Cathedral down to what would become Weygand Street. This is the street where the Sursock Souk was held before the civil war. These days, the souk and the street are gone, replaced by the open-air archaeological park that will eventually become the Garden of Forgiveness.</p><p>The Serail was the work of Manouk Avedissian, the Armenian architect also known as Bechara Effendi Avedissian, who was the chief engineer of the Vilayet of Damascus. He began work on it in 1881 and while he couldn’t know it at the time, the governor would soon abandon the Petit Serail, for the (more defensible) confines of the Grand Serail on the bluff above town and the Wali’s residence would become a telegraph office.</p><p>By 1939, the Serail’s destruction was already being discussed. Plans drawn up under the French Mandate called for the expansion of Martyr’s Square through the creation of a series of terraces that would open views out over the sea. This did not happen, however, and by the time it was eventually pulled down in 1950, it was to be replaced by two new buildings; the Regent Hotel and the Rivoli Cinema. In all, a building the city had been forced to mortgage property and raise new taxes to finish stood for barely 66 years and served its original function for less than a decade.</p><p>As for the bear who built it - for in addition to being known as al-Muhandess (or the Engineer), Manouk Avedissian was also known as el-Deeb (or the Bear), presumably for his imposing appearance - Bechara Effendi also left his mark on the old arts and crafts school in Sanayeh (the building that gave the neighbourhood its name and which will soon become the National Library and Archive) and the Imperial Ottoman Bank, a long-gone building that was one of the first sights greeting voyagers arriving at the port.</p><p>Shortly after finishing the Serail, Avedissian was called on to help with the excavation of the recently discovered Royal Necropolis outside Sidon. Applying his knowledge of engineering to the dig, he’s credited with working out a more efficient way to transport the heavier finds and also for discovering a cluster of burial chambers that contained some of the most impressive tombs ever found in Lebanon. Some of the sarcophagi unearthed can be seen at the National Museum but the three most striking finds - the Tabnit, the Mourners and the Alexander sarcophagi - were immediately shipped off to the Imperial capital.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/70bbd8ce-6653-4d94-bd69-7d2c7fc33058.jpg" alt="" title=""><p>The Alexander Sarcophagus, which may have been made for a governor of Babylon, gets its name for the exquisitely carved battle scenes featuring the Two-Horned One that decorate its length and is now considered to be the greatest treasure of the Istanbul Archaeology Museum. The Tabnit, a much older black basalt sarcophagus carved in the Egyptian style, is less visually impressive but when it was found, it still contained the body of its occupant, the * Milennium BC king of Sidon, Tibnit, who was found perfectly preserved and still afloat in the fluids used to embalm him. Incredible? Don’t take our word for it.</p><p>“At Sidon I naturally visited the spot where the famous sarcophagi were found, and was interested to hear that when the sarcophagus of Tabnit, the Phoenician king, was opened, it was found to be filled with a liquid, in which lay the body as fresh as though buried the day before,” William Pepper, M.D., LL.D., and President of the exploration fund at the University of Pennsylvania, which undertook an expedition to Babylonia between 1888-1890, wrote of his visit to Sidon. “Only the nose, which projected above the liquid, was black and withered. Unfortunately, the workmen, supposing the liquid to be water which had leaked in, poured it off before they could be stopped, and the body quickly became corrupt.”</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21">The Bear Who Built a Palace</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
